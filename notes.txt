CD19 - B cells
CD3 - T cells
CD33 - Monocytes
CD34 - Hematopoietic stem cells
CD7 and CD16 - Natural Killer cells

Natural Killer cells
---------------------
Express a unique combination of the core surface markers:
CD45+
CD45RA+
CD38+
CD19-

which distinguishes them from other cell types.

Phosphorylation Markers
-------------------------
TNF induction of phosphorylated MAPKAPK2 was observed in myeloid and NK cell types

"LPS-induced degradation of total IkaBa (an indicator of NFkB pathway activation), was restricted to cells of the monocytoid lineage (which uniquely expresses the receptor for LPS)."

phosphorylated STAT5 (after stimulation with thrombopietin, TPO) expected in HSCs
