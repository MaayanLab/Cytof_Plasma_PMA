Mainly wiki notes on pre-defined cell types

pDCs (Plasmacytoid dendritic cells)
  Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are innate immune cells that circulate in the blood and are found in peripheral lymphoid organs. They develop from bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells and constitute < 0.4% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)

  In humans they exhibit plasma cell morphology and express
  + CD4
  + HLA-DR
  + CD123
  + BDCA-1 (blood-derived dendritic antigen-2)
  + TLR7 (toll-like receptor)

  within endosomal compartments, but do not express high levels of
  - CD11c (conventional dendritic cells)
  - CD14 (monocytes)

  which distinguishes them from conventional dendritic cells or monocytes respectively

NKT cells
  Natural killer T (NKT) cells are a heterogeneous group of T cells that share properties of both T cells and natural killer cells. Man of these cells recognize the non-polymorphoic CD1d molecule, an antigen-presenting molecule that binds self and foreign lipids and glycolipids.
