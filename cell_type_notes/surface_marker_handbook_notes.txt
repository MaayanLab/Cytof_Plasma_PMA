        In immunology, the CD3 (cluster of differentation 3) T-cell co-receptor helps to activate the cytotoxic T-cell. It consists of ...

        Immunohistochemistry: CD3 is initially expressed in the cytoplasm of pro-thymocytes, the stem cells from which T-cells arise in the thymus. The pro-thymocytes differentiate into common thymocytes, and then into medullary thymocytes, and it is at this latter stage that CD3 antigen begins to migrate to the cell membrane. The antien is found bound to the membranes of all mature T-cells, and in virtually no other cell type, although it does appear to be present in small amounts in Purkinje cells.

        The high specificity, combined with the presence of CD3 at all stages of T-cell development, makes it a useful immunohistochemical marker for T-cells in tissue ... The antigen remains present in almost all T-cell lymphomas and leukemias, and can therefore be used to distniguish them from superfically similar B-cell and myeloid neiplasms.

    CD4
        T Cell, CD4 T helper cells

        In molecular biology, CD4 is a glycoprotein found on the surface of immune cells such as T helper cells, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. CD4+ T helper cells are white blood cells that are an essential part of the human immune system. They are often referred to as CD3 cells, T-helper cells or T4 cells.

    CD45
        T Cell, B Cell, Dendritic Cell, NK Cell, Stem Cell Precursor,
        Macrophage/Monocyte, Granulocyte

        Protein tyrosine phosphtase, receptor type C, also known as PTPRC or CD45 antigen. A monoclonal antibody

        http://www.abcam.com/cd45-antibody-ab10558.html

        CD45 phosphatase is required for T-cell activation through the antigen receptor. Acts as a postitive regulator of T-cell coactivation upon binding to DPP4.

    CD27
        T Cell, B Cell, NK Cell

        CD2 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. It is currently of interest to immunologisst as a co-stimulatory immune checkpoint. This receptor is required for generation and long-term maintenance of T cell immunity.

        It is discussed in a B-cell identifying handbook.

        Decreased CD4(+) T cell counts are the best marker of disease progression during HIV infection. However, CD4+T cells are heterogeneous in phenotype and function, and it is unknown how preferential depletion of specific CD4+T cell subsets influences disease severity. CD4+T cells can be classified into three subsets by the expression of receptors for two T cell-tropic cytokines. IK-2 (CD25) and IL-7 (CD127). the CD127 subsets includes IL-2 producing naive and central memory T cells, the ...

        T Cell, B Cell, NK Cell, Macrophage/Monocyte

        It is a type I transmembrane protein present on activated T cells, activated B cells, some thymocytes, myeloid precursors, and oligodendrocytes. ...

    CD8
        T Cell <- cytotoxic T cells

        Cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that serves as a co-receotpr for the T cell receptor (TCR). Like the TCR, CD8 binds to a major...

        The CD8 co-receptor is predominantly expressed on the surface of cytotoxic T cells, but can also be found on natural killer cells, cortical thymocytes, and dendritic cells. ...
